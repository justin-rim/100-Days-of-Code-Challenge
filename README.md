# 100-Days-of-Code-Challenge
Web Developer Track

Hi Github. Here's my 100 Days of Coding Challenge. I'm looking to get into Web Developing and so far enjoying it. One of my goals is to be ready to begin applying for positions/freelance within 3-4 months of prep, knowing it's a heavy challenge.

I technically started on 4/11/2020, but I have been very resistant thus far to actually start on a project. To make-up for the lost time and days, I shall be playing catch up, posting multiple days, if not, adding an additional day or two for this challenge.

I will be working with HTML, CSS and Javascript to start, and also will look into PHP for some back-end.

All feedback is appreciated!
